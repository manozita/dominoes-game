# PROGRAMMING LAB - THE GAME OF DOMINOES

## Description 
Group project that consisted of creating a code in C language for a game of dominoes.

## Interface
### Main Page
The program's interface initially presents itself with a main menu, with 7 options:  

1) Start of the game for 2 players;

2) Beginning of the game against the machine, easy level; 

3) Return to a game that has already started; 

4) Save the game to an external file; 

5) Recover the game from such external file; 

6) Game rules page; 

7) Program exit option.

### Beginning

After the game starts, a new interface is displayed, which contains: the table of pieces already played, in order, the number of pieces in storage, the player's number and the pieces in that player's hand. At this point, the user has the following options: 

1) Play a piece of his hand; 

2) Buy a piece; 

3) Checking to skip (since it is only allowed to pass if there are no possible moves and the deposit is empty); 

4) Return to the main menu.

### How to Win

The game features two conditions for ending (winning): 

1) The player wins if they run out of pieces and the deposit is empty. 

2) If none of the players have playable pieces and the deposit is empty, the winner is determined by the player with the fewest pieces. In case of a tie, the tiebreaker is the points count per piece.

### Main Menu
 
Upon returning to the main menu, the user has the option to resume the game already started in the same program, as well as the ability to save the current game and recover it later from an external file, outside the program. If there is no game available for these actions, an error will be displayed, and the player will be redirected back to the main menu. 

In addition to these options, there is a game rules section, which lists the essential aspects that players should know in order to achieve success in the game.
